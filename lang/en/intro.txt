====== RefNotes Configuration ======

On this page you modify the configuration settings used by [[doku>plugin:refnotes|RefNotes plugin]]. There are three sections that group related settings:

  * **General settings**
    * //Use footnotes syntax// --- if enabled the RefNotes plugin will be used to handle native DokuWiki footnotes along with it's own syntax.
  * **Namespaces** --- in this section you can specify rendering style for pre-defined namespaces. For the detailed explanation of each style see the [[doku>plugin:refnotes:style|style reference]].
  * **Notes** --- this section is used to pre-define commonly used notes.
    * //Inline// --- specifies if the note should be [[doku>plugin:refnotes:syntax#inline_notes|inlined]].

Settings that are shown on blue background are the default values. In the //Namespaces// section settings that are shown on green background are inherited from the parent namespace.

Remember to press the **Save** button on the bottom of this page before leaving otherwise your changes will be lost.
